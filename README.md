# Game World

Players can explore and play dungeons built by dungeon builders.
Playing a dungeon is primarily a web2 experience to encourage wider adoption.
Some dungeons can introduce hybrid experience such as showcasing onchain assets from other projects or triggering a web3 action (finding a loot or completing the game).

## Dungeons Directory

The dungeons directory allows players to easily search and find different dungeons.
It also allows builders to easily share their dungeons.

## Game Play

Playing a dungeon is very simple

### Controls

Platform: The game is playable on any browsers including mobile browsers.

- Keyboard: W,A,S,D or arrow keys allows players to move forward, backwards, turn left or right
- Touch/Mobile swipe: Players on touch devices can swipe the screen to perform the same actions as above

## Building

Building a dungeon can be done using the browser based map editor

<img src="app/public/assets/img/rockwall.png" alt="Rock Wall" width="200"/>
<img src="app/public/assets/img/wall3.png" alt="Rock Wall" width="200"/>

### Objects

Builders can add objects such as props or characters
